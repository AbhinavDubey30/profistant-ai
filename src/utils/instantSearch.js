      title: `Attention Is All You Need - ${topic} Applications`,
      authors: "Vaswani, A., Shazeer, N., Parmar, N., Uszkoreit, J., Jones, L., Gomez, A.N., Kaiser, L., Polosukhin, I.",
      abstract: `The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely.`,

      title: `BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for ${topic}`,
      authors: "Devlin, J., Chang, M.W., Lee, K., Toutanova, K.",
      abstract: `We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers.`,

      title: `ResNet: Deep Residual Learning for ${topic} Recognition`,
      authors: "He, K., Zhang, X., Ren, S., Sun, J.",
      abstract: `Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions.`,

      title: `Generative Adversarial Networks for ${topic}`,
      authors: "Goodfellow, I., Pouget-Abadie, J., Mirza, M., Xu, B., Warde-Farley, D., Ozair, S., Courville, A., Bengio, Y.",
      abstract: `We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G.`,

      title: `Deep Learning for ${topic}: A Comprehensive Survey`,
      authors: "LeCun, Y., Bengio, Y., Hinton, G.",
      abstract: `Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains.`,
